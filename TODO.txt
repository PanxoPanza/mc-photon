# TODO list
- Eliminate REGION dependence in "Monitor" class
- Kill photon after many scattering events in the same region
- Fix code for correct parallel computing work
- Change frequency units to microns
- Change dimension units to mm
- Warning msg for extrapolated values (Mie scattering and others).
    "Warning extrapolated values at SOMEWAVELEGNTH in thefile.mie"
- Add a generic filename and add this name to each monitor
- add a debug command to read from .setup file
- take flags from command line
- take refractive index from nk data (not from eps)
- get nk from .nk file extention
- automatically detect eof from nk data
